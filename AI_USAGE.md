# AI Usage Documentation

This document details where and how AI assistance was used in the development of the ExecutionRouter project.

## AI Tools Used

- **GitHub Copilot**: Code completion and boilerplate generation
- **Claude (Anthropic)**: Code refactoring, containerization, and documentation

## Areas Where AI Assisted

### Code Generation & Boilerplate
- **Project Structure**: Initial scaffolding following Clean Architecture patterns
- **Configuration System**: IOptions pattern implementation and environment variable binding
- **Dependency Injection**: Service registration and configuration setup
- **Controller Templates**: Basic API controller structure and routing

### Implementation Assistance
- **HTTP Executor**: HTTP client patterns and request forwarding logic
- **PowerShell Executor**: Basic runspace management (heavily modified for Exchange Online)
- **Validation Logic**: Input validation patterns and error handling
- **Health Endpoints**: Basic health check and metrics endpoint structure

### Infrastructure & Documentation
- **Containerization**: Multi-stage Dockerfile and Docker Compose configuration
- **Documentation**: README.md structure, examples, and API documentation
- **Configuration Examples**: JSON request/response examples

## Human-Driven Decisions

### Architecture & Design
- Clean Architecture implementation and layer separation
- Domain model design and business rules
- Retry strategy and resilience patterns (Polly integration was human-decided)
- Security considerations and PowerShell command allowlisting

### Core Logic
- Execution orchestration and request routing
- Error classification (transient vs non-transient)
- Metrics collection and observability patterns
- PowerShell session management and Exchange Online integration

## AI Limitations Encountered

- Required significant modification for domain-specific requirements
- Generated overly complex solutions that needed simplification  
- Needed human oversight for security and architectural consistency
- Limited understanding of Exchange Online PowerShell specifics

## Collaboration Approach

**AI was most effective for**: Boilerplate code, standard patterns, documentation structure
**Human expertise was essential for**: Architecture decisions, business logic, security design, domain knowledge

## Transparency Statement

This project represents a collaborative development approach where AI accelerated implementation of standard patterns while human expertise drove architectural decisions and domain-specific logic. All AI-generated code was reviewed, tested, and often significantly modified to meet project requirements.

Estimated AI contribution: ~40% of code volume, with 100% human review and validation.
